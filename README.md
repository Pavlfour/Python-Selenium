I'm currently working as a RSA at Avis Car Rental company in Greece. I wrote this code,so when a contract from our desk is formed, i'm getting an sms to my phone
from my Twilio account,so i don't have to refresh the avis special program at the RAC where i'm working (different location) all the time.
That way i get notified when a car is given and after that i check the computer (program) to read the whole contract.
