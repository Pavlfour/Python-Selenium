Im currently working as an RSA at Avis Car Rental company in Greece. I wrote this code,so when a contract from our desk is formed, im getting an sms to my phone
from my Twilio account,so i dont have to refresh the avis special program at the RAC where im working (which is at a different location) all the time..
That way i get notified when a car is given and after that i check the computer (program) to see the whole contract. So im the lazy type programmer :D
